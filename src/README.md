Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

To run the program simply type *make* and it creates a file names token_test.
Run token_test(./token_test) in order to start the tokenizer.

# Known Bugs

  - When getting history it skips input for next command.

# Collaboration

  - Abram helped me fix a bug in my get_history function where the list would
   not proceed to go to the next item.

# Resources

Needed a way to compare string to make the user interface and I found a great
website that explains how strcomp() works in C.
