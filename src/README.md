Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

some input.

# Known Bugs

-After tokenizing sentence, if there is no space at the end it does not read
 the last word.(FIXED)
-When printing tokens, error message "Segmentation fault (core dumped)"
 appears. This is because print_tokens is trying to access information that is
 not there.
